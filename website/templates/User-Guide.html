               <p>
                  Another way of thinking of <strong>Meaning Analysis</strong> is <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>. This allows us to '<em>analyse</em>' free-text according to what it tells us about how the respondents '<em>feel</em>' about whatever we have asked them to give comments on. '<em>Sentiment</em>' is another way of saying '<em>feeling</em>' but could include respondents' opinions or reactions too.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                  In <strong>Meaning Analysis</strong>, you will find the tools to carry out your own <strong>sentiment analysis</strong>. It might be useful to get a broad idea of how <em>positive</em> or <em>negative</em> the feedback you have received is. Once you have selected the data you want to use and put it into the program, your first option is between <strong>3 class sentiments</strong> or <strong>5 class sentiments</strong>.
              </p>
          
              <h3><strong>3 class sentiments</strong></h3>
              <p>Will let you <strong>analyse</strong> your data according to what percentage of it indicates (1) positive (2) neutral (3) negative feelings (<strong>sentiment</strong>).</p>
          
              <h3><strong>5 class sentiments</strong></h3>
              <p>Will let you <strong>analyse</strong> your data according to what percentage of it indicates (1) very positive (2) positive (3) neutral (4) negative (5) very negative feelings (<strong>sentiment</strong>).</p>
          
              <p>
                  This information can be presented as (i) a <em>pie chart</em> (ii) a <em>bar chart</em> and/or (iii) a <em>sentiment table</em>. You will also see an <strong>overall sentiment</strong> score giving a general indication of whether the overall sentiment of your data is negative, neutral or positive.

By clicking on the <strong>download interactive...</strong> tab under each one, you can save a copy of the required chart(s) as a discrete file. An example of the bar chart is shown below. On the y-axis you can see the ‘<strong>count</strong>’, which indicates the number of times sentences in the text were classified according to each type of <strong>sentiment</strong> shown on the x-axis (i.e. negative, neutral, and positive here). If you scroll over each bar in the bar chart (or piece of the pie chart), the <strong>count</strong> will also be shown.

                  In addition, there is a <strong>sentiment table</strong>. In the example below, an overall sentiment score is given which in the case of the data analyzed below, suggests an overall positive sentiment. The number of entries viewed can be changed from 10 to up to 100 entries at a time. The <strong>sentiment label</strong> column will list either one of the 3 class sentiments appropriate to the selected sentence in the table or one of the 5 class sentiments depending on what you chose earlier. The <strong>confidence score</strong> tells you how confident FreeTxt is with the accuracy of the score given here. A confidence score of 0.99 (out of 1) tells you that the tool is very confident that the sentiment label is correct. By clicking on <strong>sentiment label</strong> or <strong>confidence score</strong> you can order your data according to sentiment or confidence accordingly.

                  The <strong>Sentiment Chart</strong> allows you to create a <strong>scatter plot</strong> of your data.

                  Below is a <strong>scatter plot</strong> based on the data in example data in FreeTxt (see <em>'use example data'</em> in the <em>'How can I...'</em> section). The top positive and top negative/neutral words are listed in columns to the right of the plot. Hovering over a word in these lists highlights where it is in the <strong>scatter plot</strong>, which is useful if you have large amounts of data to analyse. By hovering over a specific word in the <strong>scatter plot</strong>, you see information about how often it is used in the dataset, along with its’ score (ranging from -1 to 1).

                  If you click on an individual word within the <strong>scatter plot</strong>, you can view examples of how it is used in sentences with either a positive and/or negative sentiment in your text. For example, clicking the word <em>'budget'</em> in the sample data, you will see all of the occasions <em>'budget'</em> is used in a sentence that has been analysed as being positive.

              <p>When we have a large amount of text, it can be useful sometimes to visualize everything in such a way that all the key words - that is the words which are used most often in the text - are clearly larger and more prominent than others which occur less often.</p>
              
              <p>A <strong>Word Cloud</strong> is one way which enables us to do this. We call it a <strong>word cloud</strong> because this information is often (but not always) shown in the shape of a cloud. Below is an example of a <strong>word cloud</strong> (not in the shape of a cloud!) created using text relating to the TV show Dr Who:</p>
              <hr>
              <img src="./static/images/img/analysis/Pic12.png" class="special-image">
              <hr>
              <p>Clearly, the most commonly used word here is <em>Doctor</em> as we might expect (its larger size, compared to the other words, tells us this). Other commonly used words include: <em>BBC</em>, <em>series</em>, <em>time</em>, <em>episode/s</em>, <em>television</em>, and <em>first</em>.</p>
              
              <p>A <strong>word cloud</strong> is a handy tool for giving us a visual representation of what the important and stand-out words in a piece of text are. This can be useful, for example, in presenting the main emphasis within a text in a simple, visual way to an audience who might be interested in the topic. An example of this is how some news outlets' online sites (e.g., Sky News) occasionally use a <strong>word cloud</strong> to illustrate what the most frequent words in an important political speech were i.e., where the main emphasis was concentrated and what that tells us about the message being conveyed. Using a <strong>word cloud</strong> to do this may be a more effective way of illustrating this to the reader than just through a news article.</p>

              <button class="accordion" id="word-cloud-def-button">Is a Word Cloud only based on how often words occur in a specific text?</button>
                  <div class="panel" id="word-cloud-def-panel">
               <p>The size of the words in some <strong>word clouds</strong> is directly related to how often they occur in the text you are looking at - these are <strong>word clouds</strong> based on the <strong>frequency</strong> of words in your text. <strong>Word clouds</strong> can also tell us about the nature of the <strong>key words</strong> in them - for example, as the word <em>the</em> is the most common word in the English language, this is the word that we expect to be used most often in a text. Showing <em>the</em> in a word cloud wouldn’t be particularly interesting as it doesn’t show us anything we wouldn’t expect. <em>The</em> is not ‘key’ to a particular text, as it is common to all texts. If a word like <em>castle</em> occurs a lot of time in your text (perhaps if you are looking at reviews of a castle!), it would be defined as ‘key’ because it isn’t expected to be common in everyday language. <strong>Key words</strong> tell us what the most significant words in a given text are (by comparing their frequency to a 100 million word dataset of written and spoken language called the British National Corpus). <strong>Key words</strong> are calculated using a measure called the <strong>keyness value</strong> and we would call a <strong>word cloud</strong> which is directly related to <strong>keyness value</strong> rather than solely frequency a <strong>key word cloud</strong>. You can choose which option you would prefer for your own analysis within the <strong>word cloud</strong> tool (see below) – the <strong>key word cloud</strong> option is the default option for FreeTxt.</p>

              <p>Here you are able to analyse <em>how</em> the words in your data are used (in particular in connection with each other) and <em>what</em> their relationships can tell you about the wider meaning of your text. It is useful to consider more closely how different words can have a different meaning or tell a different story when they occur together. Their relationship with each other and the coming together of two words in this way can be referred to as <strong>collocations</strong>.</p>
                    </div>
              <button class="accordion" id="collocation-button">What is a 'Collocation'?</button>
                    <div class="panel" id="collocation-panel">
              
          
              <p>It might be helpful to think of this term <strong>collocation</strong> as two parts - the second one <strong>location</strong> tells us where something is and the first part <strong>co­­-</strong> is often used to make us think of something together (e.g. <strong>cooperate</strong> - working together). So, <strong>collocation</strong> will tell us about words which are often <strong>located together</strong> and because they are located together, they combine to give a particular meaning.</p>
          
              <p>Let's look at a word like <em>pay</em> for example. On its own, it can be a verb <em>to pay someone</em> or a noun <em>I received my pay today</em>. However, it is possible to <strong>locate</strong> other words <strong>together</strong> with <em>pay</em> to create combinations with specific meanings. Some examples might be:</p>
          
              <ul>
                  <li><em>Equal pay</em></li>
                  <li><em>Pay packet</em></li>
                  <li><em>Pay scale</em></li>
                  <li><em>Half pay</em></li>
                  <li><em>Gladly pay</em></li>
                  <li><em>Pay up</em></li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>These combinations all add to the meaning of the verb or noun <em>pay</em> and occur naturally in language. In the first four examples, <em>pay</em> = money or earnings but the combinations we have noted with <em>equal / packet / scale / half</em> would not work with <em>money</em> as well.</p>
          
              <p><em>Equal money</em> is a possible <strong>collocation</strong> of <em>money</em> but <em>money packet</em>, <em>money scale</em> and <em>half money</em> are not.</p>

             <button class="accordion" id="collocation-why-button">Why might I want to look for collocations / word relationships in FreeTxt?</button>
                    <div class="panel" id="collocation-why-panel">
     
          
              <p>Being able to search for <strong>collocations</strong> in your text will help you get a greater understanding of meanings which only become apparent when we see two words <strong>located together</strong>. If we consider, for example, text which includes feedback on accommodation. It is probable that the word <em>room</em> will be a high frequency word, that is one which occurs very often in the text.</p>
          
              <p>However, in order for the accommodation owner to understand and analyse that information in more detail, being able to identify <strong>collocations</strong> with <em>room</em> would be a very useful tool:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Which adjectives <strong>collocate</strong> with <em>room</em> and what do they tell us about it e.g. <em>warm</em> or <em>hot / cold</em>; <em>noisy</em> or <em>quiet</em>; <em>double</em> or <em>single</em>.</li>
                  <li>Does the text refer to specific rooms e.g. <em>dining / bed / reception</em>?</li>
                  <li>Are there any other specific <strong>collocations</strong> which help the accommodation owner understand more about what is targeted in the feedback e.g. <em>room key / room rates / adjoining room</em>?</li>
              </ul>

The example used here has limited data and so the <strong>frequency</strong> is not so great (i.e. the amount of times each word in your text occurs) - however, the greater the amount of data used, the higher the frequency number will be. The other columns relate to <strong>MI - Mutual Information</strong> and <strong>LL - Log Likelihood</strong> (the <strong>MI</strong> score is a statistical measure that shows the strength of association between words; <strong>LL</strong> is a probability statistic that compares the frequency of co-occurrence of two words). Clicking on any of the column headings will arrange the data in order of the specific column selected. Once again, this analysis can be downloaded for use outside of FreeTxt. If you selected a particular <strong>POS Tag</strong> or <strong>Semantic Tag</strong> at the start of your analysis, the words shown in this table are those which most frequently occur within that given category.</p>
